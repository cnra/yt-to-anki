00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:03.939
What if doing well in school and in life

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:09.630
depends on much more than your ability to
learn quickly and easily?

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.710
I started studying kids and adults

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.940
in all kinds of super challenging settings,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.980
and in every study my question was,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.259
"Who is successful here and why?"

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.289
My research team and I went to West Point
Military Academy.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.060
We tried to predict which cadets would stay
in military training

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.289
and which would drop out.

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.120
We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried
to predict

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.160
which children would advance farthest in competition.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.809
We partnered with private companies, asking,

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.460
"Which of these salespeople is going to keep
their jobs?

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.600
And who's going to earn the most money?"

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.140
In all those very different contexts,

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.870
one characteristic emerged as a significant
predictor of success.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.429
And it wasn't social intelligence.

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:59.070
It wasn't good looks, physical health, and
it wasn't I.Q.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.499
It was grit.

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:06.580
Grit is passion and perseverance for very
long-term goals.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.760
Grit is having stamina.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.110
Grit is sticking with your future,

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.400
day in, day out, not just for the week,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.980
not just for the month, but for years,

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.640
and working really hard to make that future
a reality.
